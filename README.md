Hey there! :wave: This repository is an initiative aimed at increasing productivity within our Sales Department at HeyJobs. I've created several tools that streamline common tasks, allowing our team to spend more time doing what they do best: connecting companies with amazing talent!

**Please note that this project was created exclusively in spare time, but it is a demonstration of a passion for automation and a commitment to improving work efficiency. Even though I am very happy with my current job, in perspective a development into a developer-sales hybrid role could be quite interesting.**

Currently, the repo consists of two main tools:

1. **Kürzel-Finder**: Assists in finding shortcuts for a company based on their name and description.
2. **Jobtyp Bestimmen**: Determines the job type based on the given job description.

Each tool has its own dedicated page where users can interact with a clean and intuitive UI. The tools are built on top of Next.js framework and utilize Axios for making API requests, Sqlite3 for storing data and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

For more technical details, please check the source code of the two main pages:
- [Kürzel-Finder](./src/pages/get-category/index.tsx)
- [Jobtyp Bestimmen](./src/pages/get-job-type/index.tsx)

## Future Work :hourglass_flowing_sand:

This repository is an ongoing project, and there are plans to introduce more tools in the future. My main objective is to make life easier for everyone on the Sales team, and I believe that the best way to achieve this is by building tools that cater to our team's needs.
